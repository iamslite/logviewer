logviewer
=========

This is a tool for accessing the logs from a host purely through 
a web interface. It allows the logs to be gathered together in one 
place, even if they aren't on the server, and allows the log content
to be processed. This allows logs that consist of multi-line entries
to be viewed as complete entries.

History & Copyright
-------------------

This is the continuation of a tool originally written for internal 
use by [Object Source](https://objectsource.co.uk/). As such the
initial copyright rests with them. However, I requested a copy of
the code to release as an open source project and was given the 
version as checked in for the initial commit.
